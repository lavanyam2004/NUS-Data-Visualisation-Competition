# NUS Data Decades Data Visualization Competition

## Overview

This project was undertaken as part of the NUS Data Decades Data Visualization Competition, where our team was awarded **2nd Runner Up** for our innovative analysis and visualization of music trends from the 1980s. Working under a tight 2-hour deadline, we leveraged data-driven storytelling to uncover insights into the evolution of music over the decades.

## Project Objectives

- **Team Management:**
  - Effectively managed a 3-person team, delegating tasks and overseeing workflow to ensure the timely delivery of our project.
  
- **Data Visualization:**
  - Utilized Python on Google Colab to create dynamic visual aids, including correlation plots and heatmaps, to visually explore relationships within the musical trends dataset.
  
- **Innovative Analysis:**
  - Integrated a Kaggle dataset on current music trends with the 1980s music data, generating comparative insights that informed actionable recommendations.

## Key Contributions

- **Team Leadership:**
  - Led the team through effective communication and task delegation, ensuring that all deliverables were completed on time.
  
- **Technical Proficiency:**
  - Demonstrated strong skills in data visualization by leveraging Python and R to create insightful visualizations, highlighting key patterns in the data.
  
- **Creative Approach:**
  - Sourced a separate dataset from Kaggle to compare music trends across different eras, enhancing the depth of our analysis and providing unique value to the project.

## Results

Our presentation to the judges showcased our innovative approach to data analysis and strategic thinking. We effectively leveraged data to tell a compelling story about music trends, demonstrating how trends from the 1980s compare with current musical trends.
