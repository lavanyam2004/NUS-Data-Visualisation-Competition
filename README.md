NUS Data Decades Data Visualization Competition: 2nd Runner Up 
In this project, I led a 3-person team to analyze and visualize music trends from the 1980s within a tight 2-hour deadline. 
My responsibilities included:

Team Management: Effectively managed workflow and delegated tasks to ensure timely delivery of our project.
Data Visualization: Utilized Python on Google Colab to create correlation plots and heatmaps, enabling us to visually explore relationships within the music trend data.
Innovative Analysis: Integrated a Kaggle dataset on current music trends with the competitionâ€™s 1980s music data, generating comparative insights that informed actionable recommendations.
Our innovative approach to data analysis, coupled with strategic thinking, was showcased in our presentation to the judges, demonstrating our ability to leverage data for impactful storytelling.
